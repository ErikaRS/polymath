The productification trap
Picking up on last week's 3P insight, I want to share some insights I've learned about a common trap of working in two-sided markets. I call this trap the "productification trap", and it appears in two different varieties.
The first variety is more common at companies and teams that have accumulated expertise of building consumer experiences, mastering the 1P-2P relationship and elevating consumer experience as the product. This expertise tends to create blindness toward the other side of the market. These organizations tend to underestimate the potential of nurturing a relationship with developers and treat them as annoying gnats, or at best tolerate them. A common sign of the 2P productification trap is an ecosystem whose developers endure high costs of participating. I once used the metaphor of "crawling over crushed glass to just ship something." Many mobile developer ecosystems began their journeys from this trap.
Another variety occurs with companies who excel at 1P-3P side of the market. Their products offer amazing developer experiences, yet tend to not pay attention to the consumer outcomes. As long as developers are happy, we're good, right? The developer experience becomes the product. A common sign of the 3P productification trap is an ecosystem where user experiences are bloated and unwieldy. When thinking of ecosystems in this trap, I am reminded of enterprise tools and at many points in its life, the Web.

Choosing kale
Chatting with my friends about choosing developer frameworks, we accidentally arrived at this kale metaphor. It sounded witty and fun, so I'll try to unpack it as best as I can. To begin, I will apply the value triangle lens from a while back, going over the edges of the triangle. I only need them as examples of the improbable extremes. What's up with all the triangles in my posts lately?
A framework that favors the user/ecosystem edge will present itself as a promise of a high-minded idea, then quickly reveal a toy upon a close examination kind of like one of those fake fruits arranged on a dinner table to spruce up the interior. As a child, yours truly once was lucky enough to taste one of those fruits and learn a valuable lesson about appearances. Yum, stale wax.
Building on the tasting metaphor, the combination of business and ecosystem value usually produces frameworks whose taste is best described as cardboard, I guess? There's definitely important ingredients like fiber in there, but the dietary value and enjoyment are nigh nil. Large companies tend to produce these frameworks for internal use and almost without fail, the quality of their developer experience tends to wind downward with time. These frameworks aren't picked. They grow in place.

Add one point for each "yes'' answer. Scored 3 points? Congratulations! Otherwise, we still have work to do.

Ones and Twos ( Andreessen Horowitz ) Ben Horowitz, the venture firm's co-founder, theorizes that there are two types of executives at a company: Type Ones, who prefer to set the strategic direction, and Type Twos, who prefer execution and optimization. He then shows how these dynamics give companies two flawed options when trying to pick an internal candidate to replace a departing CEO.

Hearing the sound of silence
Environmental experts advise the government on rapidly addressing climate change. Meanwhile, players in the oil industry lobby for a slow, gradual rollout of renewables that favors their existing business model. Both domain experts and self-interested lobbyists (of course, the line between them is often blurry) have something in common: like the proverbial squeaky wheel that gets the grease, interested and motivated parties tend to have more influence. Persistence is part of what gives them power. Even if their view is a minority one, the highly-interested exert influence because they regularly invest energy toward realizing their desired outcome. The well-tested hypothesis goes that when a decision maker keeps getting nudged in a certain direction, they will tend to lean toward it unless they have a strong view pushing another direction.
This isn't necessarily a bad thing. When the majority opinion is largely neutral, interested parties can help break through the apathy. A passionate expert can guide the mostly-aligned majority through the details. However, problems start emerging when the influencer's view goes against the more weakly-held majority opinion. In the short run, this leads to outcomes that go against the wishes of the majority. In the long run, this undermines the legitimacy of the decision-making apparatus.

The Fed is working on a cheap, real-time payment settlement system
The US Federal Reserve has set a target launch date of mid-2023 for FedNow, its new instant payment settlement platform. Besides making funds available instantly (even on weekends), the new platform should have 80% lower fees than debit cards . Partner banks will be able to build on top of the platform to add payment features to new or existing products. (This system is neither blockchain-based nor a central bank digital currency.)

The White House is working on research to cool the globe by reflecting sunlight
The US's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is developing a five-year research plan for "rapid climate interventions," including reflecting sunlight to reduce the greenhouse effect. Several techniques are reportedly being considered: spraying aerosols into the stratosphere, increasing the reflectivity of clouds over the ocean, and thinning cirrus clouds that trap atmospheric heat.

Chinese chip designers are slowing down processors to avoid US sanctions
The US recently announced sanctions that "cap the processing power of any semiconductor shipped into China without a license," likely in a bid to slow down China's silicon industry. Chip factories in mainland China aren't advanced enough to make state-of-the-art chips, so Chinese chip designers need to rely on the Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC . But since that requires importing semiconductors into China, these designers have had to modify their chip designs to purposely reduce processing speeds thereby rendering much of their recent R&D efforts useless.

Publishing Changes
You have two publishing options:
Publish this publishes your post only to the web.
Publish & Send this publishes your post to the web and at the same time sends the post out by email.
Note : Once you have sent an email out, the only way to send it again is to create an entirely new post. Any edits you make to a post that has already been published will only be reflected on the web. So, there's no need to worry about accidentally spamming your subscribers with repeat emails.
Finally, if you import posts from some other site's archives, you can backdate them so they are published in the correct order and associated with the correct publication dates. To do so, after you have published a post, go into that post's Settings (just to the left of the Publish button) and select the desired date.
