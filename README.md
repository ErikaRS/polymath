### Developing

It's recommended to use `virtualenv` to manage your python environment for this project.

If you don't have `virtualenv`, install it with `pip install virtualenv`.

After checking out the repo, create a virtualenv:

`virtualenv env`

Every time you open a new terminal, activate the environment with `source env/bin/activate`.

After checking out the repo and activating your environment install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Every time you add a new depenency, update the dependency list with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
